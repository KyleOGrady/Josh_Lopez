          <h2>Coming From Hardship, and Inciting His Way Back into Hardship</h2>
          <p>Growing up on the streets of Rome NY, Josh Lopez was forced to fend for himself at an early age. He still has vivid memories of
          riding his Razor scooter around downtown Rome, challenging the city's homeless population to fights, hoping to cop a free meal. 
          In a constant search for food and water, Lopez was arrested numerous times for shop lifting and inciting riots. This struggle changed suddenly at age 9, when Lopez discovered how to program advanced algorithms in C++. From this point on, he decided to focus on his 
          career as a developing software engineer.</p>

          <p>At age 12, Lopez was admitted to Standard University's Computer Science program, and graduated two years later with high honors.
          At this point, he created a search engine known as "Foogle", but was arrested for inciting another riot before he could launch 
          the site. During a search of his house, Larry Page came across his work, and decided to copy it and launch his own search engine,
          known as "Google". After witnessing Page's success, Lopez became enraged and incited yet another riot in Rome, resulting in 4 
          deaths and 3 pregnancies. At this point, the State of New York gave Lopez an ultimatum; either spend his life behind bars, 
          or complete a diversion program in the CS department at Clarkson University. Choosing the latter, Lopez now wishes he had 
          chosen the former. </p>
